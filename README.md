# mocha-json-reporter

[![Node.js Package](https://github.com/dannysilence/mocha-json-reporter/actions/workflows/npm-publish-github-packages.yml/badge.svg?branch=main&event=registry_package)](https://github.com/dannysilence/mocha-json-reporter/actions/workflows/npm-publish-github-packages.yml)

## Overview

Mainly same as default mocha json reporter, but also contains hashing function to _randomize_ output file names so running multiple mocha processes sequentially won't overwrite the output.

## Install via NPM

```shell
npm i @dannysilence/mocha-json-reporter
```
